Example
=======

This project includes a test suite that demonstrates most of TestBench's features. Since much of those features involve test failures, the suite can be expected to fail. The purpose of this project is solely demonstrative.

Installation
------------

Install this project's dependencies locally with +install-gems.sh+:
